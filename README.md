# Realtime softbody simulation in the Browser with WebGPU

This is a realtime simulation of softbodies with collisions, running in the browser using the three.js WebGPURenderer.

See it running live [here](https://holtsetio.com/lab/softbodies/)!

## Credits

The softbody simulation is based on the WebGL implementation in [TetSim](https://github.com/zalo/TetSim) by [Johnathon Selstad](https://github.com/zalo). I reimplemented it in three.js TSL and added collision detection.
